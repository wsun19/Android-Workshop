# Setup

Please go through the setup before the workshop begins - it takes quite a while to download everything!

1) [Download Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/)

2a) If you plan on running your app on your computer, choose to have a "custom" instead of "standard" setup at this screen:

Then, select to install all components.

2b) If you plan on running your app on your phone, install Android Studio with default settings, and then make sure you [enable developer options and USB debugging](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options#enable).

In addition, I highly recommend that you enable these settings to automatically import any necessary Java packages we will be using. Please make sure you check "Add unambiguous imports on the fly" and "Optimize imports on the fly (for current project)".

# Starting the Project

For the base of this project, we're going to be using the [official introduction for building an app](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/creating-project), from the Android Developer's website.

When you're done with this tutorial, we'll continue to add a few new features!

# Creating a List

# Accessing the Internet

# What next?
## For this project, try to look up and figure out how to...
- Have the list refresh and add more Pok√©mon when you scroll to the bottom of the list.

# In General
- Follow more guides. Udacity and official website (same thing?)
- Use different APIs. For example: Rotten Tomatoes, Some Google data sets https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch ???,
- Polish the UI.
- Use Firebase/GCP.
- TODO think of stuff that's associated with branded prizes.

# Common Issues
- If you have used Android Studio before, you may have issues with rendering a preview of your app. In that case, refer to the help [linked here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51709049).
- If you have issues with running the app on your device, and the error involves split APKs, you may need to [disable Instant Run](https://stackoverflow.com/a/34817880).

# General Troubleshooting
- Google is your friend! :)
  - Stack Overflow often shows up in Google results to help.
  - Us, mentors (?) at HopHacks
